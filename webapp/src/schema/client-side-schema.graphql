# The way apollo says you should do client side schema
# is different from the way graphql codegen says.

# If I want to use whatever apollo features come with client side schema,
#I need to duplicate this stuff, but use the 'extends' syntax etc

#// https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/local-state/client-side-schema/

# this file implements the way graphql codegen wants it done
# https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/docs/integrations/apollo-local-state
# MAYBE TODO -
# refactor so that forgot is a key with an array value. that array has objects
# with enum StudyType and forgotten Boolean. Means we don't have to interpolate
# the enum into the key name which is messy

#TODO think of something better than the forgotREAD forgotLISTEN solution
type SentenceWord {
  lastClicked: Int!
  forgotREAD: Boolean
  forgotLISTEN: Boolean
}
# I don't remember what this type is for - maybe for word level study?
type Word {
  forgotREAD: Boolean
  forgotLISTEN: Boolean
}

type Query {
  sentenceWord(sentenceId: String!, stanzaId: Int!): SentenceWord
}
