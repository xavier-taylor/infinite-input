These are incomplete representations of a schema - for example, they don't include Unique constraint. Thus they are just a starting point 

Below are the steps that must be manually applied to the schema that this tool generates.

## Add unique constraints:

## Remove NOT VALID

## Add in range (1,7) constraints on hsk 2010 levels

## add index on hsk level, and include a function index for hsk char level (ie to find the 174 level 1 hsk chars)
