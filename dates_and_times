Unfortunately graphql doesn't have a date as a built in.

For now, all dates, date times etc are existing in graphql as strings.
These strings area generally teh result of calling new Date().toISOString()
They are stored in sql as timestamp with timezone, which I believe is nice and specifc

The string that you get from new Date().toISOString() can be stored losslessly in a timestamp with timezone.
When you get the value back from the database, you can pass it into the new Date() constructor.
Then you can pass new Date().toISOString() to the frontend etc.

What is the definition of 'today'?

Today is calculated relative to the users own timezone (lets leave adding custom day start/end times, like anki, till later).

For queries where we need to ask questions like (relative to the users timezone) how many words have they learned today?

GOT IT:
1. import luxon's DateTime.
2. get now: now = DateTime.now() 
this gets the current time (ie in local time, with offset etc)
3. get start = now.startOf('day')
4. start.toUTC().toISO()

That gets us the UTC time of the start of the users current day.
Then we can just plus a day to that to get the end of the user's current day.



What does it mean for something to be due?
    for student_word - due is just absolute point in UTC time.
    Why? Because we dont grab 'words that are due today', we just grab
    x either words with intermediate learning state, or just unlocked word based on
    position.

    for student_word_read and student_word_listen
    due is a point in absolute time. But what words shall we return when,
    on their local 13 sep 2022, they hit api for due words?
    We shall like the above luxon logic, calculate the ISOstring UTC for the start of that users day
    and thus parametize the api call.
